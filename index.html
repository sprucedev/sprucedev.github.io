            <h2>Containers, Testing, Deployment</h2>
            <p>
                You love containers, Spruce loves containers. Containers make risky deployments a thing of the past.
                Spruce builds your container, tests it, and then ships the tested container to production (or test, or dev, or... where would you like it?).
